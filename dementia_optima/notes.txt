# Filled missing MMSE value based on patint_id median
# Doubt
1. Fill missing values before considering class
2. Fill missing values after considering class
3. Fill missing value after considering class imbalance and random forest iterative imputer
4. Find patient wth intermidate change in status of patients
5. SVC works better with extratreeregressor, SVC suffers from imbalance of classes
6. Random-forest with mean value working better and without imbalance 
7. Feature Selctection with RFECV and then RandomForest
8. Removing missing value column after dealing with class imbalance
9. remove duplicate medication and comorbidities in episodes
10. Assign all categorical data to zero vector value  
11. Replicate episode data according to years (1 year, 2 years, 3 years) or multiple it with duration
12. drop duplicate rows from for each patient contaning one or more dupliacte episodes
13. Naive Bayes - Dimension are very high
14. Normalising data
15. Train - Without Missing values, With Missing Values, After calculating Missing Values
16. Fill missing values before class imbalance ??
17. 


Plots to be considered:
1. How the rank of a feature is varying according to the particular class (plot)
2. Positive correlated feature plots
3. Correlation bitween different feature
4.
